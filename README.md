# PiLED

This project used for installing on Raspberry Pi.  
LED Strip is connected to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.  
This program opens TCP server on port 3384 and waits for plain TCP packets, created as described here:

## TODO:
- [x] Basic color change
- [x] Protocol parser with all needed checks
- [x] Setting up pigpio and setting color to pins
- [x] Use config file
- [x] Some basic animations support  
- [x] Get current color support in protocol
- [ ] OpenRGB SDK support (connect to server, get devices, choose where to set and set colors on them too)
- [x] Use config file from home directory
- [x] systemd service



LED PROTOCOL v4
Simply contains `HEADER` + `HMAC-SHA-256` + `PAYLOAD`  
Currently max buffer size: 8+8+1+1+32+1+1+1+1+1 = 55 bytes.

## HEADER Structure
| Offset |   Name   | Size              | Version | Description              |
| :----: | :------: | :---------------: | :-----: | ------------------------ |

|  0x8   |nonce     | 8 bytes, unsigned |    1    |Random data               |
|  0x10  |version   | 1 byte, unsigned  |    1    |Used version of protocol  |
|  0x11  |OP        | 1 byte, unsigned  |    3    |Operational code          |


## HMAC-SHA-256 (32 bytes)
Must be generated with SHA-256 algorithm with using `shared_secret` which writed in both client and server and `data` must be used `header+payload`:
`HMAC(SHA-256, shared_secret, header + payload)`

## Packet-Specific Documentation

## LED_SET_COLOR
Request size: 55 bytes (`HEADER` + `HMAC` + `PAYLOAD`)  
Response size: 0 bytes (no response)  
Sets up RGB color, defined in `PAYLOAD` to GPIO pins.

## LED_GET_CURRENT_COLOR
Request size: 50 bytes (`HEADER` + `HMAC` without `PAYLOAD`)  
Response size: 11 bytes  
The response contains `timestamp` when response package created (8 bytes) and RGB values (3 bytes summary respectively).  

## ANIM_SET_FADE
Request size: 55 bytes (`HEADER` + `HMAC` + `PAYLOAD`)  
Response size: 0 bytes (no response)  
Starts FADE animation. To `PAYLOAD` must be added `Speed` field as described at [PAYLOAD Structure](#payload-structure)

## ANIM_SET_PULSE
Request size: 55 bytes (`HEADER` + `HMAC` + `PAYLOAD`)
Response size: 0 bytes (no response)
Start PULSE animation. In `PAYLOAD` must be provided color fields and `Duration`.

## Client Side Workflow
1. Generate Timestamp and Nonce  
    * Timestamp: Use Unix time (seconds since January 1, 1970). (64-bit)  
    * Nonce: Generate a random number to ensure each request is unique. (64-bit)
2. Prepare the Payload
    * The payload contains the actual data to be sent to the server, such as the color value.
3. Generate the HMAC
4. Pack package and send to server

## Server Side Workflow
1. Receive and Parse the Request
   * Receive the header, HMAC, and payload.
2. Verify Timestamp and Nonce
   * Ensure the timestamp is recent and the nonce hasnâ€™t been used before.
3. Recompute the HMAC
   * Data to HMAC: Concatenate the header and payload.
   * HMAC Calculation: Recompute the HMAC using the shared secret.
   * Compare the recomputed HMAC with the received HMAC. If they match, proceed; if not, reject the request.
4. Process the Request
   * Process the color value from the payload.
