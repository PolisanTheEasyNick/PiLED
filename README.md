## HMAC-SHA-256 (32 bytes)
Must be generated with SHA-256 algorithm with using `shared_secret` which writed in both client and server and `data` must be used `header+payload`:
`HMAC(SHA-256, shared_secret, header + payload)`

## Packet-Specific Documentation

## LED_SET_COLOR
Request size: 55 bytes (`HEADER` + `HMAC` + `PAYLOAD`)  
Response size: 0 bytes (no response)  
Sets up RGB color, defined in `PAYLOAD` to GPIO pins.

## LED_GET_CURRENT_COLOR
Request size: 50 bytes (`HEADER` + `HMAC` without `PAYLOAD`)  
Response size: 11 bytes  
The response contains `timestamp` when response package created (8 bytes) and RGB values (3 bytes summary respectively).  

## ANIM_SET_FADE
Request size: 55 bytes (`HEADER` + `HMAC` + `PAYLOAD`)  
Response size: 0 bytes (no response)  
Starts FADE animation. To `PAYLOAD` must be added `Speed` field as described at [PAYLOAD Structure](#payload-structure)

## ANIM_SET_PULSE
Request size: 55 bytes (`HEADER` + `HMAC` + `PAYLOAD`)
Response size: 0 bytes (no response)
Start PULSE animation. In `PAYLOAD` must be provided color fields and `Duration`.

## Client Side Workflow
1. Generate Timestamp and Nonce  
    * Timestamp: Use Unix time (seconds since January 1, 1970). (64-bit)  
    * Nonce: Generate a random number to ensure each request is unique. (64-bit)
2. Prepare the Payload
    * The payload contains the actual data to be sent to the server, such as the color value.
3. Generate the HMAC
4. Pack package and send to server

## Server Side Workflow
1. Receive and Parse the Request
   * Receive the header, HMAC, and payload.
2. Verify Timestamp and Nonce
   * Ensure the timestamp is recent and the nonce hasnâ€™t been used before.
3. Recompute the HMAC
   * Data to HMAC: Concatenate the header and payload.
   * HMAC Calculation: Recompute the HMAC using the shared secret.
   * Compare the recomputed HMAC with the received HMAC. If they match, proceed; if not, reject the request.
4. Process the Request
   * Process the color value from the payload.

## Requirements
* RPi with running `pigpiod`
* `libssl-dev`
* `libconfig`
  
## Building and Running
* `git clone --recursive https://github.com/PolisanTheEasyNick/PiLED`
* `cd PiLED`
* `mkdir build`
* `cd build`
* `cmake ..`
* `make`
* `./piled`  

You can also install piled to your system using:  
`sudo make install`  
which will copy executable to `${CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR}`, which often refers to `/usr/local/bin/piled` along with config file copy at `/etc/piled/piled.conf` and systemd service file at `/etc/systemd/system/piled.service`.  

## Configuring
You can configure PiLED by editing config file /etc/piled/piled.conf or by copying him into ~/.config/piled.conf and editing at home dir.  
Note that systemd service is not running as any user so it may not find your home directory by $HOME.  
If you want OpenRGB device changing too, do not forget to define `OPENRGB_SERVER` at config file and run `openrgb_configurator` as described at [OpenRGB](#openrgb) section.  

## OpenRGB
PiLED supports connecting to OpenRGB server for setting current color to PC's controllers.  
For configuring OpenRGB you need to specify OpenRGB server IP and port.  
Then you need to run `openrgb_configurator` executable with root perms, which is built along with `piled`.  
Root is needed because configurator will create file with your picked PC's controllers at `/etc/piled/openrgb_config` (and later will be read by systemd service, for example).  
After OpenRGB is set, any requests for changing color to PiLED would be automatically retranslated to OpenRGB server and your PC will be in-sync with PiLED.
