# led-server

This project used for installing on Raspberry Pi.  
To GPIO pins connected LED strip.  
TODO:
- [x] Basic color change
- [x] Protocol parser with all needed checks
- [x] Setting up pigpio and setting color to pins
- [ ] Use config file
- [ ] Some basic animations support
- [ ] OpenRGB SDK support (connect to server and set colors too)  
This program opens TCP server on port 3384 and waits for packets, created in this protocol:

LED PROTOCOL v2
Simply contains `HEADER` + `HMAC-SHA-256` + `PAYLOAD`
Currently max buffer size: 8+8+1+32+1+1+1+1 = 53 bytes.
Note that config lines are hardcoded into `utils.h`

## HEADER Structure
```
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
|                            HEADER                         |
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+ 
|timestamp: 64-bit signed integer; 8 bytes                  |
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+  
|nonce:     64-bit signed integer, random; 8 byte value     |
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+   
|version:   8-bit signed int, 1 byte version of protocol.   |
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
```  

## HMAC-SHA-256 (32 bytes)
Must be generated with SHA-256 algorithm with using shared_secret which writed in both client and server and data must be used header+payload:
HMAC(SHA-256, shared_secret, header + payload)

## PAYLOAD Structure
```
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+-+
|          PAYLOAD           |
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+-+
|RED color:   8 bits, 1 byte |
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+-+
|GREEN color: 8 bits, 1 byte |
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+-+
|BLUE color:  8 bits, 1 byte |
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+-+
|Duration:    8 bits, 1 byte |
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+-+
```
Duration contains time in seconds of duration of animation of changing color from current to asked.

## Client Side Workflow
1. Generate Timestamp and Nonce  
    * Timestamp: Use Unix time (seconds since January 1, 1970). (64-bit)  
    * Nonce: Generate a random number to ensure each request is unique. (64-bit)
2. Prepare the Payload
    * The payload contains the actual data to be sent to the server, such as the color value.
3. Generate the HMAC
4. Pack package and send to server

## Server Side Workflow
1. Receive and Parse the Request
   * Receive the header, HMAC, and payload.
2. Verify Timestamp and Nonce
   * Ensure the timestamp is recent and the nonce hasnâ€™t been used before.
3. Recompute the HMAC
   * Data to HMAC: Concatenate the header and payload.
   * HMAC Calculation: Recompute the HMAC using the shared secret.
   * Compare the recomputed HMAC with the received HMAC. If they match, proceed; if not, reject the request.
4. Process the Request
   * Process the color value from the payload.
